## Featured 3D Project: "Magic Mushroom"
A cinematic opening sequence created for a short film. This project demonstrates high-level proficiency in 3D environment design and animation.

* **Key Technical Features:**
    * **Dynamic Lighting & Volumetrics:** Implemented glowing emission shaders for the portal and mushrooms to create an atmospheric, surreal "glow" effect.
    * **Particle Systems:** Created custom firefly and ember particles to add life and movement to the static forest environment.
    * **Procedural Texturing:** Developed unique, swirling textures for the portal gate and organic textures for the forest floor.
    * **Cinematic Composition:** Focused on camera focal length and "Bokeh" depth-of-field effects to guide the viewer's eye.
* **Tools:** Blender (Cycles Render Engine), DaVinci Resolve (Post-processing).
